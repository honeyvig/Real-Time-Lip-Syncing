# Real-Time-Lip-Syncing
 I record a video of myself and then I can project this video of myself on zoom like OBS virtue camera and then when I talk my AI clone will basically lip syncing me in the zoom call.

Great example here is an company called get pickled ai. I need exactly like that

We are seeking an experienced AI engineer to develop a real-time lip syncing solution that can be projected on platforms like Zoom and Google Meet. The ideal candidate should be familiar with existing open-source projects and have the ability to customize and enhance functionality for seamless integration. Your expertise will help enhance virtual communication experiences, making them more interactive and engaging. If you have a passion for AI and innovative technologies, we want to hear from you!
-----------------
To create a system where you can project an AI-generated, lip-synced version of yourself during video calls on platforms like Zoom and Google Meet (similar to the concept of OBS virtual camera), you'll need to tackle multiple components. Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved and a Python-based approach to implement it.
Key Components for the Project:

    Lip-Syncing Model: A deep learning model that can take your recorded audio and generate lip movements that match the speech in the video.
    Virtual Camera: A virtual camera system (like OBS) that will project the output video with the AI-generated lip sync into Zoom or Google Meet.
    Audio-to-Video Synchronization: Real-time synchronization between the audio (your speech) and the video (AI-generated lip sync).
    Integration with Video Conferencing Tools: Using OBS or similar software to create a virtual camera and project the video stream into Zoom or Google Meet.

Libraries and Tools Needed:

    Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch or TensorFlow for lip-syncing models.
    Virtual Camera: OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) can create a virtual camera to project the AI-generated video.
    Audio Processing: Python’s pydub or librosa for audio processing and synchronization.
    Face Detection: OpenCV for detecting the face and aligning the generated lip sync.
    Lip Sync Models: Pretrained models like First Order Motion Model or Wav2Lip.

Step-by-Step Python Code:
1. Setting Up Wav2Lip Model (Lip-Syncing Model)

You can use pre-trained models like Wav2Lip (a state-of-the-art lip-sync model). This model generates lip movements based on the speech input.

Install Dependencies:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-python numpy dlib

Download Wav2Lip Model: You can download the pretrained model from the official Wav2Lip repository.

git clone https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git
cd Wav2Lip
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Lip Syncing Code

import os
import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np
import librosa
from Wav2Lip import inference
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, AudioFileClip

# Function to extract audio from a video file
def extract_audio(video_path, audio_path):
    video_clip = VideoFileClip(video_path)
    audio_clip = video_clip.audio
    audio_clip.write_audiofile(audio_path)
    return audio_path

# Function to sync lip movements using Wav2Lip
def generate_lip_sync(video_path, audio_path, output_video_path):
    # Load Wav2Lip model
    model_path = 'Wav2Lip/checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth'  # Path to the pre-trained Wav2Lip model
    model = torch.load(model_path)
    model.eval()

    # Generate lip-sync video
    output_video = inference.sync_face_video(video_path, audio_path, model)
    cv2.imwrite(output_video_path, output_video)

    print(f"Lip-synced video generated at {output_video_path}")
    return output_video_path

# Example usage:
video_path = 'input_video.mp4'
audio_path = 'input_audio.wav'

# Step 1: Extract audio from video
audio_path = extract_audio(video_path, audio_path)

# Step 2: Generate lip-sync video
output_video_path = 'output_video.mp4'
generate_lip_sync(video_path, audio_path, output_video_path)

3. Setting Up OBS Virtual Camera

After generating the lip-synced video, the next step is to use OBS Studio to create a virtual camera that will stream your generated video to Zoom or Google Meet.

    Install OBS Studio: Download and install OBS Studio from https://obsproject.com/.

    Install OBS-VirtualCam Plugin: This plugin allows OBS to create a virtual camera that can be used by other applications like Zoom or Google Meet.
        Download and install the OBS-VirtualCam plugin from OBS VirtualCam GitHub.

    Set Up Virtual Camera in OBS:
        Open OBS Studio.
        Add your video source (the lip-synced video from the previous step) by clicking the "+" button under the "Sources" panel and selecting "Media Source" or "Window Capture" depending on how you want to stream.
        Click Start Virtual Camera (under the "Tools" menu in OBS).

    Stream to Zoom or Google Meet:
        In Zoom or Google Meet, select the OBS Virtual Camera as your video input source.

Step 4: Real-Time Lip Syncing

For real-time lip syncing, you need to modify the flow to continuously process live video and audio. Here's an outline of how this can be done:

    Capture live video using OpenCV and audio using a microphone.
    Pass the captured video and audio to the lip-sync model for real-time processing.
    Output the lip-synced video to the OBS Virtual Camera.

import cv2
import numpy as np
import pyaudio
import librosa
import torch
from threading import Thread
from Wav2Lip import inference

# Real-time lip sync function
def live_lip_sync(video_source=0, model_path='Wav2Lip/checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth'):
    # Initialize video capture and audio stream
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)
    audio_stream = pyaudio.PyAudio()
    
    # Initialize Wav2Lip model
    model = torch.load(model_path)
    model.eval()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Capture audio from microphone (you can adjust the format, channels, and rate)
        audio_data = audio_stream.read(1024)  # Placeholder for audio data capture
        audio_clip = librosa.load(audio_data, sr=16000)

        # Process video and audio for lip syncing
        lip_sync_output = inference.sync_face_video(frame, audio_clip, model)
        
        # Show the lip-synced output
        cv2.imshow("Lip-Synced Video", lip_sync_output)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Run live lip sync
live_lip_sync()

Step 5: Integrating With Zoom / Google Meet

The final step is to project the real-time video to Zoom or Google Meet. You can use OBS to create a virtual camera, which will then allow Zoom or Google Meet to use the AI-generated video as a webcam feed.

    Start OBS with your AI lip-synced video.
    Start the OBS Virtual Camera (as mentioned in Step 3).
    In Zoom or Google Meet, select OBS Virtual Camera as your video source.

Additional Considerations:

    Latency: Real-time lip syncing may introduce some latency depending on your hardware. Optimizing the processing time of both audio and video streams is crucial.
    Audio Input: Make sure the audio is synchronized with the video. For live systems, you can use a microphone input and stream it to the model as you speak.
    Quality: Ensure that both the AI model and your computer's hardware are optimized to handle the real-time video generation.

Conclusion:

This approach uses a combination of deep learning (for lip syncing) and software tools (OBS and virtual camera) to create an AI-driven avatar that mimics your speech and lip movements in real time during Zoom or Google Meet calls. By leveraging existing models like Wav2Lip, OBS for video streaming, and combining them with Python for processing, this solution can be customized to fit your needs.
